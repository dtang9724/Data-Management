# This graph shows the average SAT score of each state, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. 
# The color of the states ranges from red to green.

# The greener the state, the higher the average SAT; the redder the state, the lower the average SAT.
# The purpose of this graph is to allow the user to see the general education quality across the US continent from the standpoint of SAT.

# Discussion (viz 2):
# This graph shows a linear correlation relationship between the number of cylinders and the overall MPG.
# The purpose of this graph is to determine whether more cylinders will lead to less overall MPG, in other words, more full consumption.
# After fitting a line into the scatterplot, I performed a linear regression summary.
# According to the summary, even though the line shows there is a negative correlation between cylinders and overall MPG, under the 5% confidence level, this relationship is not statistically significant, as the p-value 0.011678 is larger than 0.05.
# This is primarily because the overall fuel consumption of an 1-cylinder car actually is similar to that of a 5-cylinder car.
# In other words, the 1-cylinder car consumes more fuel that we think it does.
